- I prefer programming in Clojure
- Most hacking tooling is in python
- Basilisp

For now just a breeding ground for Basilisp and other Clojure hacking
utils, solve scripts and so forth.

*Usage*
Launch basilisp with src/ added to PYTHONPATH, e.g

#+begin_src sh
PYTHONPATH=../basifangs/src basilisp repl
#+end_src
